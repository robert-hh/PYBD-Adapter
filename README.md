The Small one has a 0.3" distance between the 0.1" Sockets, leaving more
2-3 rows available on a breadboard. It has to be assembled on the top
side of the PYBD.

The Wide one has a 0.8" distance, allowing (partially) stacking headers,
but leaving only 1 row free on a breadboard and may be assembled on
